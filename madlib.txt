I walk through the color jungle. I take out my massive canteen.
There's a loaud parrot with a whole rabbit in his mouth right in front of me in the flippin' trees! I gaze at his large beak.
A sudden sound awakes me from my daydream!
A panther runs in front of my head! I smell his stinky breath.
I remember I have a packet of pills that makes go into a deep slumber!
I blow it away in front of the parrot.
Yes he's eating it! I run away through the dark jungle. I meet my parents at the tent.
Phew; Itâ€™s been an exciting day in the jungle.
