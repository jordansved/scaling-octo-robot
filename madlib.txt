I walk through the color jungle. I take out my bad canteen.
There's a  parrot with a fast tiger in his mouth right in front of me in the long trees! I gaze at his big tail.
A sudden sound awakes me from my daydream!
A panther jumps in front of my head! I sense his hot breath.
I remember I have a packet of pills that makes go into a deep slumber!
I push it away in front of the panther.
Yes he's eating it! I jump away through the color jungle. I meet my parents at the tent.
Phew; Itâ€™s been an exciting day in the jungle.
