Sophia

I walk through the color jungle. I take out my juicy canteen.
There's a normal parrot with a hunky tooth in his mouth right in front of me in the tangled trees! I gaze at his toothy maw.
A sudden sound awakes me from my daydream!
A panther erupts in front of my head! I eat his malevolent breath.
I remember I have a packet of absinthe that makes go into a deep slumber!
I throw it away in front of the fire.
Yes he's eating it! I slither away through the evil jungle. I meet my parents at the tent.
Phew; Itâ€™s been an exciting day in the jungle.
