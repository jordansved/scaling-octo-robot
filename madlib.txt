[Your Name]

I walk through the color jungle. I take out my curmudgeonly canteen.
There's a phat parrot with a wobbling pimple in his mouth right in front of me in the ephemeral trees! I gaze at his wobbling pimple.
A sudden sound awakes me from my daydream!
A panther undulates in front of my head! I marvel at his crystallized breath.
I remember I have a packet of ramen that makes go into a deep slumber!
I substantiate it away in front of the goldfish.
Yes he's eating it! I jetski away through the upsetting jungle. I meet my parents at the tent.
Phew; Itâ€™s been an exciting day in the jungle.
